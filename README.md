# Resume Overhaul

My old resume was just an HTML Template Website. This new redesign it taking the skills I learned from a group project.

This resume is built entirely with Vue 3 and Bootstrap here and there.

Some keys things I wanted to learn while making this website:

- Flexboxes and how they interact
- Mobile friendly web design

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
