This project is the one you are currently looking at! I learned what I used from several of my classes at NIU. This website was built using a Vite and Vue.js project. The main purpose was to really test what I can do without group members doing their part. Another purpose was to challenge myself towards Mobile Friendly design and the use of CSS FlexBoxes.
